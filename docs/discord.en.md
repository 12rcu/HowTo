You can join our Discord server on [https://timolia.de/discord](https://timolia.de/discord).
Here you can hang out with your friends and the community. Moreover, you can also seek for support, report bugs,
participate in giveaways and much more.
However, if you want to join voice channels, Discord is not the place to go. We offer them on our [TeamSpeak](/teamspeak/) server whilst on Discord only chat channels are available.
Hereinafter you will find a short overview of the most important information about our Discord server. Everything else you will find directly on the Discord in the channels listed in the category "Informationen". 


# 1 - Verification on the Discord
- When joining the Community-Discord, you will be assigned the unverified role. By verifying with your Minecraft account you receive a particular role matching your in-game rank and a few new permissions on the Discord.
Moreover, you receive the subtitle "Discord Crew" in-game!
- Once you join the Discord server you will receive a message by our "<strong>Timolia Bot</strong>". (In case you do not receive any messages, please make sure to allow private messages by all users on our Discord server! 
With `/join` the bot will send the message again.) Also <strong>ensure to be online in-game and message the bot</strong> with `/verify <your in-game name>`.
After that, click on the message which you received in your <strong>Minecraft chat</strong>.
- In case you are banned, you can join *register.timolia.de* and verify yourself there.

# 2 - Discord rules
You can either view the rules of the Discord server in the channel [#regeln](https://discordapp.com/channels/407554118887014402/407565978025852929) on our Discord server or [here](/rules/discord/).

# 3 - Private channels
On our Discord server we offer temporary <strong>chat channels</strong> for rent. Below, we listed some more information for you.

## How do I create a private channel?
You can obtain a private channel by messaging a team member. Ideally, you use `/support <issue>` in the private chat with the 
Timolia bot or in the channel [#support](https://discordapp.com/channels/407554118887014402/413594798906408960).

## Price of a private channel
The channel costs <strong><u>1,000 Pixel</u> per month</strong>.

## How do I add a friend?
You can add members to your channel with `/channel invite <@name>`. With `/channel remove <@name>` you can remove a member again.

## Rules in the private channel
- The <strong>maximum duration</strong> for which a channel may be created in advance is <strong>6 months</strong>.
- Every user may only have <strong>one private channel</strong> at a time.
- It is possible to share the channel and the costs with friends. But you should note that only one rightful owner may exist. 
In case of any discrepancies between the owners, they have the sole claim on the channel.
- After expiration, the channel gets locked. Upon renewal, it gets unlocked again and all previous messages will be kept.


# 4 - The scoring system 
## How does it work?
The count of all messages longer than a certain minimum length is used to calculate the score.

## How often do messages get included in the score?
Depending on the rank of the user, a cooldown between the messages gets applied. Therefore, the score cannot be boosted with spam.

## How many points will I receive for a single message?
You will receive 1-20 points â€“ but only if your message fits the requirements to be included in the score.

## Where am I able to view my current score?
You can view your current score the resulting rank by writing `/rank` wither in the private chat with the 
Timolia bot or in the channel [#support](https://discordapp.com/channels/407554118887014402/413594798906408960).
In the same way, you can use `/top` which shows a list of the top 10 users with the highest rank.

## I wrote a pretty long message which was not included in my score
Not all messages from every channel are included. For example, private channels and support chats are excluded.

## How many points do I need to rank up?
For the lowest rank, you need 128 points. From then on you always need double the points of the previous rank to rank up. The second rank, therefore, needs 256 points, the third 512, the fourth 1024, etc.

<strong>All users who exploit (or try to exploit) this system, e.g. with massive spam, will be reset to 0 points.</strong>
