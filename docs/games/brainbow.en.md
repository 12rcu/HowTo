## The basic idea

BrainBow is a teamgame where aim and fast reactions are of the essence. The last team standing wins the game.

## How to play
- Use `/vote <Map>` or the options displayed in the chat to vote for your preferred map. 
- Up to four teams compete in a game.
- Every team starts the game in their own base.
- The whole floor of the map is filled with special blocks. Stand on them while shooting to use their special effects!
- Redstone blocks will change your arrow into a tnt. Shoot it into the colored score fields above your enemies' bases.
- If a tnt explodes in your own score field your team loses a heart. If your team lands a tnt in the enemies' fields you gain half a heart.
- Having no hearts left means not being able to respawn anymore. If all players are then eliminated, the team is eliminated as a whole.
- The last team standing wins and gains the most points and pixels.
- Reaching 1000 points in BrainBow unlocks a special trophy in the pixelshop: The BrainBow.
