## The game principle
Epic battles with up to 100 players and varied scenarios are guaranteed here! Choose your favorite scenario and fight alone or in a team to the last man. Craft your own equipment and fight the battles in your own way.

## That's how it works

The main goal the game is to eliminate all opponents and survive as the last lone fighter or as the last team.
Each UHC has its own scenarios (e.g. Fireless = no fire and lava damage; NoClean = 30s protection time after a kill; free-for-all or teams) that significantly change your environment and gaming experience.
These scenarios can be viewed before the game starts on the <a href="https://timolia.de/discord">Timolia Discord</a> or on the <a href="https://twitter.com/TimoliaUHC"> Twitter account</a> can be viewed.
At the beginning of the game, all players are spawned on a vanilla map. During the pre-determined protection period, you can calmly prepare for the upcoming battles and farm your equipment.
In the tenth minute of the game you are healed one last time.
After the protection time expires, PvP is enabled. You should take care of yourself from now on!
The longer the game lasts, the smaller the playable map becomes. The border surrounding the playing field gradually decreases. If you find yourself outside the border after shrinking, you will be teleported back onto the playing field.

## Premium-Features
After being eliminated from the round, Premium players have the option to continue spectating the gameplay.
