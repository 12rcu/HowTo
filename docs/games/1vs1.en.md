## The game concept

Play alone or in teams against your opponents in 1vs1. Choose your own or other kits and find out in fair fights who is
the better one. The kit can be freely assembled from everything that the creative inventory, anvil and enchantment table
have to offer.
"Hackerkits" can be created via the black market vendor, these contain modified items. Work your way up the career
ladder in our ranked system and become the highest-ranked player on the server. Challenge other players or teams or take
part in a tournament and prove yourself to other players.

- A left-click on a player challenges him to a duel, a right-click invites him to join a team.
- Force the end of a fight with '/endmatch'. You can find more information [here](#endmatch).
- Blocks burst after 15 seconds in every tournament and ranked match, in regular games when `/endmatch` is used.
- Clicking on the ghast tear in the hotbar provides an overview of all arenas in the lobby
- With a right-click on a player currently in a fight, you can watch the fight from his perspective.
- The redstone comparator offers settings for queuing, kits, maps and fights as well as various options for the lobby
  and chat.
- To find even fairer matches even faster, you can play against players on all servers in the global queue.
- All fight statistics can be viewed with /statsmenu or by clicking on the stats skeleton in the lobby.

## Ranked system

Work your way up the career ladder in our ranked system and become the highest-ranked player on the server. In total
there are 17 ranks to reach. Each player has an assigned value in 1vs1, the ranked points. If you win a match against
your opponent, they increase, if you lose a match, points are reduced. Your rank is determined by the number of your
points. You can see the exact point limits for each rank in-game with the command '/ranks'. Note that the best ranks can
only be occupied by a certain number of players at the same time. For example, only 3 players can be rank 17 at the same
time, even if more than 3 players have >8500 points. You can find all the information about your current rank and your
score under `/season`.

| Rank | Points | |
| :------: | :------: | ----- |
| <b><span class='minecraft-darkgray'>1</span></b> | 0 - 99 |

| <b><span class='minecraft-gold'>15</span></b> | 7200 - 7799 | (max. 50 Spieler) |

| <b><span class='minecraft-green'>17</span></b> | 8500+ | (max. 3 Spieler) |

### Calculation of the points

For each of the 6 ranked kits of a season, there is a separate ranking list. The points are calculated independently for
each ranked kit. Your global ranked points, from which your rank is calculated, are the sum of your ranked Points in
each kit. You start with 0 points in each kit. For games you won you gain points, for games you lose you lose points.
Besides the ranked points, each player has an elo value for each kit. This value is not displayed but tries to determine
your playing strength in the background. The difference between your points, your elo and your opponent's elo determines
how many points you gain or lose for winning or losing. Your initial Elo is 1000 in each kit and you can find out how
accurately Elo is calculated in our system [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system).

### Seasons

At the end of each season, all ranked leaderboards and points are reset, the top players of the last season are
displayed in the PvP lobby. All statistics (including yours) of the last seasons can be viewed in-game
with `/season [number]`. In each season 6 ranked kits are offered. You can see which ones are currently available and
how long the current season will last with `/season`. The 6 kits consist of 3 kits that are given by the team and 3 kits
the community can vote for. This voting takes place in the last week of the previous season.

## Win streaks

Earn additional Pixel with win streaks and buy great items in the Pixelshop with them. Players
with [premium](/ranks/premium/) gain more Pixel.

| Win streak | Pixel |
| ------ | ------ |

| 6 wins | 6 Pixel |
| 10 wins | 10 Pixel |
| 15 wins | 10 Pixel |
| 20 wins | 15 Pixel |
| 30 wins | 30 Pixel |

| 70 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 80 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 90 wins | 40 Pixel |
| 100 wins | 50 Pixel |

After 100 consecutive victories, the rewards do not increase, you will receive the same reward after every 10
consecutive victories. With the command '/winstreak' you can view your current win streak. Note: Your win streak only
increases if you play via the queue.

## Friday tournaments

Every Friday at 20:00 there is a big Timolia tournament. It can be entered with `/join Timolia` from any 1vs1 server.
The tournament is broadcasted live by a streamer. The respective streamers and kits will be announced
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TimoliaTeam) and the [Timolia Discord](/discord/). The winner will have the opportunity
to win the [MVP rank](/ranks/premium/) for one month. If he accepts the risk-match against the streamer and wins it, he
can even win 2 months. However, if he loses, he only gets half a month. Additionally, the top 3 receive a medal and a
respective subtitle. Also, every player who makes it to the final server will get 3 days Pro!

## End match

With `/endmatch` the end of a fight can be forced. Once this command has been executed, a fight will only last one
minute. Whoever was closest to the middle on average in the last 30 seconds wins the fight. This command cannot be used
in a tournament, of course.
`/endmatch` can only be used after a specified time which is different for different kits.  
Here you can find an overview of the minimum playing times until end match:

| Kit        | Time         |
| ---------- | ------------ |
| 1Bar       | 60 seconds  |
| Basic      | 45 seconds  |
