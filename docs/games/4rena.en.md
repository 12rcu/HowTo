## The game concept
4rena combines PvP with tactical game elements. Prove yourself against three other players with limited items.
Choose your equipment anew each round, but remember: The items can only be used once!

## And that's how it works
- Vote with `/vote <map>` or with a single click in the chat for the arena of your choice.
- At the end of the voting phase, all players will be teleported to the arena.
- There are several chests with items available to you, but you can only use them once.
- Press the button on the redstone lamp to indicate the start of the battle.
- All players will be teleported into the arena and the last survivor will win the round.
- If a fighter wins a total of five rounds, he has won the game.


## Premium features
- Premium players have up to four votes in the voting system depending on their rank.
- Premium players receive up to three times more pixels.
- Get displayed as a normal player with `/togglerank`.

You can find out which premium rank offers you which advantages [here](/ranks/premium/).
