### Appeals
From a ban of ten days on, you can shorten your ban time by up to 1/3 with an appeal, with a permanent ban your 
ban time will be reduced to 30 days. You can write an apology on the forums under the topic "Banished". 
If you don't have an account for our forum, you can register for it on the Minecraft server 'register.timolia.de'.
Alternatively you can send 
us <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=385909409" target="_blank">here</a> on Twitter a DM 
with your apology.

Since players can change, see their mistakes and improve, there is the so-called <strong>prescription of bans</strong>. 
This ensures that the ban days do not remain permanent, but rather break down bit by bit. Once the ban days expired 
so you have a maximum of 30 ban days left, you can play on Timolia again. The ban stats to expire 6 months after the 
initial start of the ban. From then on, 3 ban days are deducted from the corresponding ban every month. If you were 
banned for 30 days, after 7 months 27 days are left, after 8 months 24 days are left and after 16 months you do not have any ban days left.
